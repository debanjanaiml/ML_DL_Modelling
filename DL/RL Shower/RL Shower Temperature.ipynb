The objective of this model is to design a system which would automatically adjust the shower temperature between a sweet spot of 37 to 39 degrees. \\\n","It is assumed that the person will be taking the shower for 60 seconds. We use Reinforcement Learning to acheive this objective. The RL Agent is rewarded it is able to maintain a suitable temperature within the range and penalized otherwise.\n","\n","There are 3 states of operation of the shower knob: \\\n","DOWN (Temperature = 37): State 0 \\\n","MID  (Temperature = 38): State 1 \\\n","UP   (Temperature = 39): State 2\n","\n","We aslo use some random noise fluctations in the environment to emulate real world like situation where the atmospheric and ventillation conditions of the bathroom play a role."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YAebp513UpKm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635532558543,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24645,"user":{"displayName":"Debanjan
